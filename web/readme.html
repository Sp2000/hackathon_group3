<h2> Description of files</h2>

<p>
<h3>index</h3>
Index page listing all checklists in the database (if any). Click the name of the checklist to browse species and add matching data.
</p>

<p>
<h3>upload</h3>
Page for uploading new checklists. The checklist itself is identified by a code, which is replicated in each row of the 'checklist_species' table (there's
no separate table for checklists). Lines can be added either as text pasted into a textarea, or as a prepared txt-file to be uploaded.
</p>

<p>
<h3>browse</h3>
Browse a specific checklist. Shows a list of all species from the selected checklist, plus matched values, if any. Matched values will either come from GBIF
and contain several counts, based on 'basis of record' and date of observation, that indicate if and how that species occurs in the area covered by the
checklist; or from some other data-provider, in which case the columnn will indicate a 'Y' if the species does occur in their database.
</p>

<p>
<h3>add match</h3>
Scans a specific directory (specified in the configuration file) for data-files. The program accepts two types of data-files: JSON-formatted data files 
with GBIF counts (see 'incoming/taxonStats3.json' for an example), or CSV-files for other data-providers (see 'incoming/checklist_NL_taxonKey.txt' for an example).
Both files rely on the presence of the original sourceTaxonID to match data to the entries in the uploaded checlist. The second filetype also expects the name 
of the data-provider on the first line.
</p>
